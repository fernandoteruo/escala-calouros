## Overview
ABEUNI is a ONG in Sao Paulo, Brazil in which I am a volunteer. It does some events to help people in poor condition and during these events, there are some operational procedures to deal with. One of them is put people in departments that have different roles and method of working, usually the people are new volunteers who are in their first event. 

This kind of job is boring, so I developed an Library to be used in a Spreadsheet and make this easier. 

## Running the Application
Install the library on your app script project and use it

## Project Organization, Reference and Development
- Programming language, technology and frameworks: Google App Script (GAS), Google Drive, Google Spreadsheet

- Project contribution: clone this project, create a GAS with it and have fun.
